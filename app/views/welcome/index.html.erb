            EasyToHunt.com came about as an idea stemming from a bon fire conversation
            about booking hunts and the frustration involved with that process.
            Founded by hunters for hunters, and not created to make money but to
            encourage hunters to make memories.

            Hunting trips can be costly and also have a significant safety component.
            It is vital that significant research be done before planning a hunt,
            to give you the best chance at creating a memory, sharing outdoor
            experiences with your loved ones, and also staying safe during that
            enjoyment.
